            How to use the website
        </h3>
        <p>
            In order to use the website, you will have to find a recipe you wish to cook. To do so, you must be on the homepage and use
            the search bar. Don't worry, this should be simple as long as you follow the following steps.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Select the type of keyword you wish to find. (This is the drop down between the input and the
                <i class="fa fa-search"></i> icon).</li>
            <li>Enter the keyword(s) you wish to find.</li>
            <li>Select a recipe that you wish to get more information about.</li>
            <li>From the summary page displayed from the previous step, click on the
                <button class="btn btn-success">Start Cooking</button> button.</li>
            <li>Follow the recipe steps</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            You can find more information about the steps above by browsing through the help page.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How to use the search bar
        </h3>
        <p>
            The search bar is relatively simple to use. All that you need to do is select a keyword category and enter what you're searching
            for. The search bar allows you to search for multiple keywords at once by separating them with a ',' character.
            You may also negate (search for results without that keyword) by adding a '!' character before the keyword. If
            you but multiple '!' characters at the start, they will negate eachother. As you enter characters, recipes matching
            those criteria will be added to the list below the search bar.
        </p>
        <h3>
            How to start a recipe
        </h3>
        <p>
            Once you've found a recipe in the list that you wish to learn more about, you can click on that entry and a summary will
            appear. Within this summary, various information will be displayed. In order to start cooking the recipe (or
            to see the steps), click on the
            <button class="btn btn-success">Start Cooking</button> button. This will bring you to the recipe page which displays all the necessary information.
            It will also have a video for you to enjoy as you follow the recipe or wait for a timer to finish.
